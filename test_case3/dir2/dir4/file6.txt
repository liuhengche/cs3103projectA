To setup the RT scheduling policy and priority, we can interact with the pthread API. 
The C++ standard library defines the std::thread class as a cross-platform abstraction around the OS-level threads. 
However, there is no C++-native ways to setup the scheduling policy and priority as the OS-level APIs (such as pthread) are not standardized across platforms. 
Instead, std::thread has a native_handle() method that returns the underlying pthread_t struct on Linux. 
With the right API calls, it is possible to set the scheduling policy and priority after the creation of the thread. 
However, I find this to be a bit tedious and prefer interact with the pthread API directly so that the thread is created with the right attributes.

However, there is no C++-native ways to setup the scheduling policy and priority as the OS-level APIs (such as pthread) are not standardized across platforms. 
Instead, std::thread has a native_handle() method that returns the underlying pthread_t struct on Linux. 
With the right API calls, it is possible to set the scheduling policy and priority after the creation of the thread. 
However, I find this to be a bit tedious and prefer interact with the pthread API directly so that the thread is created with the right attributes.

However, there is no C++-native ways to setup the scheduling policy and priority as the OS-level APIs (such as pthread) are not standardized across platforms. 
Instead, std::thread has a native_handle() method that returns the underlying pthread_t struct on Linux. 
With the right API calls, it is possible to set the scheduling policy and priority after the creation of the thread. 
However, I find this to be a bit tedious and prefer interact with the pthread API directly so that the thread is created with the right attributes.

However, there is no C++-native ways to setup the scheduling policy and priority as the OS-level APIs (such as pthread) are not standardized across platforms. 
Instead, std::thread has a native_handle() method that returns the underlying pthread_t struct on Linux. 
With the right API calls, it is possible to set the scheduling policy and priority after the creation of the thread. 
However, I find this to be a bit tedious and prefer interact with the pthread API directly so that the thread is created with the right attributes.
To setup the RT scheduling policy and priority, we can interact with the pthread API. 
The C++ standard library defines the std::thread class as a cross-platform abstraction around the OS-level threads.
